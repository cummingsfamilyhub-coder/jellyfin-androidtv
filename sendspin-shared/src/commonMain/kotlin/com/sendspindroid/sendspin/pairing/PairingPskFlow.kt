 *     actually keyed by the Pairing PSK. On any other key the client aborts
 *     with `method_not_supported` and generates nothing at all. Sending it over
 *     a Sentinel-keyed session would hand a fresh long-term secret to an
 *     unauthenticated, MITM-exposed channel.
 *  2. The record is persisted only on `server/pair-finalize`. Persisting
 *     earlier leaves the client holding a credential the server never stored,
 *     which surfaces later as an `unauthorized` with no explanation.
 *
 * Single attempt at a time. The connection owns one of these.
